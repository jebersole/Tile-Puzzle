![Tile Puzzle](assets/tiles.png?raw=true)

This program has the user move shuffled puzzle tiles into their appropriate places. The board is
4x4, and up to 3 pieces may be moved at one time (highlighting around the tiles assists the user).
A timer is started once the game begins. The user may also select from various other pictures
to display on the puzzle.
To use, simply clone and open `tiles.html` in a browser. Alternatively, a live page is available [here](https://ebersole.tech/tiles/tiles.html). Note: due to the use of destructuring
assignment, this version may only be runnable in Firefox, Chrome and Edge.
Thanks to [denibrain](https://github.com/denibrain) for advice on making the js more OOP.
